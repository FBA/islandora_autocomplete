Islandora Auto-complete allows users to define auto-complete URL's to be used in a 
Drupal forms in conjuction with the #autocomplete property of form elements.

Known Issues: When uninstalling this module uninstall all dependant modules first otherwise the 
foreign key constraint will cause it to fail. 

@todo store all tables that use foreign key references in the variable 
table, remove the constraints when uninstalling.

Limitations: Can't change the source of a url once it has been created. It must be deleted and recreated with a 
different source.
